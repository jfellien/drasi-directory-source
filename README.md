# Directory Source

This library is a custom source that can be used in the [Drasi](https://drasi.io) project. It monitors file directories and reports changes to files. It does not capture the contents or relative changes, only the filename.

The [Drasi](https://drasi.io) project is a data change detection system that captures and publishes data changes in real-time. The Directory Source reports a file change so that it can be processed by a downstream system.
